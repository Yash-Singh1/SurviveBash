We are providing you a portable bed to use. To use your portable bed you have to use the bash command sleep.
The sleep command allows you to make your terminal wait for a certain amount of time. It is more useful in scripting
then terminal but can still be used. To use it you have to type in sleep a number of days, and a d, a number of hours, a h,
a number of minutes, a m, and a number of seconds and a s. Here is an example that waits 5 days 3 hours, 43 minutes, and 7 seconds:
