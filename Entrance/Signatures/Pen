You probably also want to sign this treachorous wall filled with people's signatures. When you are really creating repositories,
Git wants to know your name and email address for authentication in editing it. If you want to configure your name and email, do
the following commands:
 - git config --global user.name 'first_name last_name'
 - git config --global user.email youremail@yourdomain.com
Notice how the name is in quotes. We call this data type a string. It is used sometimes inside other programming languages to represent
a piece of text. Once you are done configuring your name and email just use cd .. to move back one directory and continue with other paths.
