There is a file named Blah in this folder. Isn't it supposted to be a top-secret paper? Use the mv command to change the name.
Say I wanted to name it work. Then I can just type in mv Blah work. This indicates what file to change and what to change it to.
If your name has a space or more inside then quotes around it. E.g., mv Blah 'Top Secret'.
