Now you have to wait for your graffiti to dry! This section covers some simple git commands and terms.
First of all, you need to know what a repository is. A repository is basically a directory that contains
other directories and files on git. Git is a version control system that allows you to save what you are doing.
For example, some big companies use git to store their code on the cloud with version control just in case of an
emergency. Git is completely free and open-source. Also, you need to know a few terms used when using it.
"Tracking" a file means git is keeping track of changes, deletions, and insertions of that file. It is best
to just keep track of all the files. However, in some scenarios you shouldn't. To keep track of all files and
directories inside a repository just type in git add -A. Also, to keep track of only some just type in git add and the file
or directory name. Say you have a folder in your computer which you want to turn into a repository. Then do git init on it.
When you are releasing your repository online then just use Github, Bitbucket, Gitland, or something else. When you want to commit your changes then
do git commit -m 'You description here'. Next, if you want to push your commits then use git push or git push origin. Sometimes you need to
git commits from the origin and base your commits on top of that. Then use git pull --rebase. The origin is where the git repository
is stored as a repository. If you want to get everything from the origin you can use git fetch origin or git fetch. Don't try this on
your computer or a bunch of errors will appear and something wrong might happen.
