There is a wall filled with paintings. You probably want to add on to them. If you want to add in a empty file you can use the touch
command. Type in touch paint.png inside the command line to create a new painting over here. Another additional capability is provided
inside the touch command. If you pass a file name that exists, it will just update the timestamp of the file and doesn't touch the content.
