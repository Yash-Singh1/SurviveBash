# SurviveBash
Play this game and learn Bash. Download git bash and clone this repository first. Next, learn the ls command. The ls command basically displays all the files in the repository. For example, if you were in the Desktop folder and executed ls then the command line will display all the files and folders in the desktop. After that, learn the cd command. It allows you to enter another folder. If you are in your Desktop and want to enter a folder called MyFolder, you would do cd MyFolder. Do that and keep on entering folders until you enter the SurviveBash folder. Then use the cat command to display the text in Begin. The cat command displays the content of a file. For example, if I want to see what is inside Begin (which you should do in the beginning after reading the README.md), then I would do cat Begin and it would display the content in that file.
