You see a wall with graffitti. You
probably want to contribute to it. Read
first then start doing it or else you
will mess up on your marks in history!
If you want to contribute to it, type
in vim Graffiti. This will open a text
editor that allows you to edit this file.
Press i and add in your mark on a new line. Next,
press SHIFT + ; and type in wq! and
hit ENTER. FYI, if you don't want to save
your changes, just do q! instead of wq!.


Look at all this graffitti:

HELLO
How are YOU DOING?
You  ... WOWW!
