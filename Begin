Welcome to SurviveBash,
Before you start you have to use the 
cd command to open a room. 
Next, learn to use the cat
command to read a message. ls is
used when you want to view what all
the files inside this folder is.
While you are typing in a file or
folder name you can hit TAB to auto-
complete it.
Have some fun!
