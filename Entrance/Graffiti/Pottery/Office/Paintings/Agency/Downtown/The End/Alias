If you haven't done the path starting through the Signatures yet then run this in the command line:
. goBack.sh
Over here you will be learning about aliases and .bachrc. To start, type in cd in the command line to get back to your user directory.
Next type in notepad .bashrc if you are on Windows and for Mac type in:
touch ~/.bashrc
nano ~/.bashrc
Now lets create an alias to make our commands easier. An alias is a custom command that replaces a longer command.
To create an alias type in the following:
alias ll = 'ls -al'
Now if you save and close and execute ll in the command line, the equivalent to ls -al will appear showing all of the directories and files
in the user directory. .bashrc is a great way of simplifying your experience in the terminal.
Now you are done with SurviveBash. I hope you had a fun time playing!
