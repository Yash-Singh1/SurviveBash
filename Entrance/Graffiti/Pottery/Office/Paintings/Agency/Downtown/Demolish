The nearby residents threaten to attack you if you don't demolish their old house for them. They can't afford the dynamite.
Lucky for you, the command line has a command that simply does that to directories. The command is rmdir <directory>. For example,
in this case you would have to rmdir OldHouse. The rmdir command only works on empty directories without other directories.
If you want to remove a directory that is not empty then use the rm -rf command instead of rmdir.
